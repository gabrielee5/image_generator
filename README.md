# Image Generator

Experimeting with image generation. This thing is sick.
It has access to Replicate models and Fal models.

The photo_maker file is the best to create images with a subject in mind, from uploaded picture.

Create a .env file to store the FIL_KEY and the REPLICATE TOKEN.

Added some models trained for different things. The logo generator seems to be doing a terrible job and the sticker generator doesnt work at all.
