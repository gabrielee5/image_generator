# Image Generator

Experimeting with image generation. This thing is sick.

In case you want to upload pictures, create a folder called 'images_to_upload' and a sub-folder specific for the single request. In the prompt it will be asked the name of this sub-folder.
It will be created a folder with all the images generated and a json file with the requests' output.

Create a .env file to store the FIL_KEY.
